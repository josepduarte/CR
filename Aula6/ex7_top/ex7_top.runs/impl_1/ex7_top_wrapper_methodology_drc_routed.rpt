TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.343 ns between ex7_top_i/concat_memory_0/U0/vector_s_reg[0][3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ex7_top_i/BinToBCD16_0/U0/int_rg_c_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.441 ns between ex7_top_i/concat_memory_0/U0/vector_s_reg[0][3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ex7_top_i/BinToBCD16_0/U0/int_rg_c_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.450 ns between ex7_top_i/concat_memory_0/U0/vector_s_reg[0][3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ex7_top_i/BinToBCD16_0/U0/int_rg_c_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

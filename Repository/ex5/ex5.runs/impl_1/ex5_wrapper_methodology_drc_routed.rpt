TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -55.365 ns between ex5_i/concat_memory_0/U0/vector_s_reg[1][1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ex5_i/SliceMemory_0/U0/dataOut_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk_pin -waveform {0.000 5.000} -add [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/jduarte/Documents/GitHub/CR/Aula6/ex5/ex5.srcs/constrs_1/imports/CR/Nexys4_Master.xdc (Line: 10))

2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------

Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin teste_i/counter_between_0/U0/count_signal_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk_pin -waveform {0.000 5.000} -add [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/jduarte/Documents/GitHub/CR/Aula4/ex1/ex1.srcs/constrs_1/imports/CR/Nexys4_Master.xdc (Line: 10))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk_pin -waveform {0.000 5.000} -add [get_ports -scoped_to_current_instance clk] (Source: c:/Users/jduarte/Documents/GitHub/CR/Aula4/ex1/ex1.srcs/sources_1/bd/ex1/ip/ex1_counter_generic_0_0/constrs_1/imports/Desktop/Nexys4_Master.xdc (Line: 10))

2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-23#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between top_i/Mux2_1_0/dataout[0]_INST_0/I0 and top_i/Mux2_1_0/dataout[0]_INST_0/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT top_i/Mux2_1_0/dataout[0]_INST_0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin top_i/counter_generic_0/U0/counter/s_countValue_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin top_i/counter_generic_0/U0/counter/s_countValue_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin top_i/counter_generic_0/U0/counter/s_countValue_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin top_i/counter_generic_0/U0/counter/s_countValue_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
